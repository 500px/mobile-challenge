# Mobile Developer Coding Challenge

This is a coding challenge for prospective mobile developer applicants applying through https://about.500px.com/jobs/ 

## Goal:

#### Develop a simple app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of currently popular 500px photos

- [ ] Fork this repo. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [ ] Android: _Java_ | iOS: _Swift 3_
- [ ] 500px API docs are here: https://github.com/500px/api-documentation. Please don't use **deprecated** [iOS](https://github.com/500px/500px-iOS-api) and [Android](https://github.com/500px/500px-android-sdk) SDKs.
- [ ] Grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying. Optionally: exclude nude images.
- [ ] Grid should work in both portrait and landscape orientations of the device.
- [ ] Grid should support pagination, i.e. you can scroll on grid of photos infinitely.
- [ ] When user taps on a photo on the grid she should show the photo in full screen with more information about the photo.
- [ ] When user swipes on a photo in full screen, preserve it's location on the grid, so when she dismisses the full screen, grid of photos should contain the last photo she saw.

### Evaluation:
- [ ] Solution compiles. If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes, bugs, compiler warnings
- [ ] App operates as intended
- [ ] Conforms to SOLID principles
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative
- [ ] Commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand
